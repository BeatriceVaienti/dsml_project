# To Do - Preliminary evaluation
report the following table without doing any cleaning on the data. Do hyper-parameter optimization to find the best solution. Your code should justify your results.

table:
|      | Logistic Regression | KNN | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Other technique |
|------|--------------------|-----|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Precision | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Recall | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| F1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Accuracy | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

Answer the following questions
- Which is the best model?
- Show the confusion matrix.
- Show examples of some erroneous predictions. Can you understand where the error is coming from?
- Do some more analysis to better understand how your model behaves.
